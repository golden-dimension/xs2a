== Signing messages ar application layer (Digest + Signature)

The ASPSP may require the TPP to sign request messages. This requirement shall be stated
in the ASPSP documentation.

The signature shall be included in the HTTP header.

The electronic signature of the TPP has to be based on a qualified certificate for electronic
seals. This qualified certificate has to be issued by a qualified trust service provider according
to the eIDAS regulation [eIDAS]. The content of the certificate has to be compliant with the
requirements of [EBA-RTS]. The certificate of the TPP has to indicate all roles the TPP is
authorised to use.

=== ASPSP Profile

The electronic signature will be enabled if ASPSP supports it:

```
{
...
 "common": {
        "tppSignatureRequired": true,
        ...
}
```

=== Request Header

|===
|Attribute |Type |Condition |Description

|Digest |String |Conditional |Is contained if and only if the "Signature"
element is contained in the header of the request.

|Signature |String |Conditional |A signature of the request by the TPP on
application level. This might be mandated by ASPSP.

|TPPSignatureCertificate |String |Conditional |The certificate used for signing the request, in
base64 encoding. Must be contained if a signature is contained, see above.

|===

*Remark:* An ASPSP will ignore signatures on application level used by the TPP if signatures
are not supported by the ASPSP.

==== Digest header

The "Digest" Header is mandatory and  contains a Hash of the
message body, if the message does not contain a body, the "Digest" header must contain the
hash of an empty bytelist. The only hash algorithms that may be used to calculate the Digest
within the context of this specification are SHA-256 and SHA-512 as defined in [RFC5843].

*Remark:* In case of a multipart message the same method is used to calculate the digest. I.e.
a hash of the (whole) message body is calculated including all parts of the multipart message
as well as the separators.

==== Signature header

"Signature" header must be present. The structure of a "Signature" header is defined in the following table lists.

|===
|Element |Type |Condition |Requirement |Additional Requirement

|keyId |String |Mandatory |The keyId field is a string that the server can use to look up
the component they need to validate the signature.
|Serial Number of the TPP's certificate included in the "TPPSignature-Certificate" header
of this request.
It shall be formatted as follows:
keyId="SN=XXX,CA=YYYYYY
YYYYYYYYYY"
where â€œXXX" is the serial
number of the certificate in
hexadecimal coding given in
the TPP-Signature-CertificateHeader and
"YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY" is
the full Distinguished Name of the Certification Authority having produced this certificate.

|Algorithm |String |Mandatory |The "Algorithm " parameter is
used to specify the digital signature algorithm to use when generating the signature. Valid values for this
parameter can be found in the Signature Algorithms registry located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/signature-algorithms
and MUST NOT be marked "deprecated". It is preferred that the algorithm used by an implementation be derived
from the key metadata identified by the 'keyId' rather than from this field. The 'algorithm' parameter will most likely
be deprecated in the future.
|Mandatory

The algorithm must identify the same algorithm for the signature as described for the TPP's public key (Subject
Public Key Info) in the certificate (Element "TPP-SignatureCertificate") of this Request.
It must identify SHA-256 or SHA-512 as Hash algorithm.

|Headers |String |Mandatory |The "Headers" parameter is
used to specify the list of HTTP headers included when generating the signature for
the message. If specified, it should be a lowercased, quoted list of HTTP header fields, separated by a single
space character. If not specified, implementations MUST operate as if the field were specified with a single
value, the `Date` header, in the list of HTTP headers. Note that the list order is important, and MUST be
specified in the order the HTTP header field-value pairs are concatenated together during signing.

|Mandatory.

Must include

* "digest",
* "x-request-id",

Must conditionally include

* "psu-id", if and only if "PSU-ID" is included as a header of the HTTP-Request.
* "psu-corporate-id", if and only if "PSUCorporate-ID" is included as a header of the HTTP-Request.
* "tpp-redirect-uri", if and nly if "TPP-RedirectURI" is included as a header of the HTTPRequest.

*No other entries may be included.*

*Remark:* It is intended to introduce a new http header in a coming version. This new header shall indicate the
creation date of a request on the side of the TPP. This new header and will also have to be included in this "Headers"
element.

|Signature |String |Mandatory
|The "signature" parameter is
a base 64 encoded digital signature, as described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648]. The client uses the `algorithm` and `headers`
signature parameters to form a canonicalised `signing string`. This `signing string` is then signed with the key
associated with `keyId` and the algorithm corresponding to `algorithm`. The `signature` parameter is then set to the
base 64 encoding of the signature. |[No additional Requirements]

=== Test data generation

For test data generation use `DigestSignatureHelper` class:

* put response data from certificate generator (encodedCert and privateKey)  to `"helper/key-pair.json"`
* example how to use `DigestSignatureHelperTest`.
