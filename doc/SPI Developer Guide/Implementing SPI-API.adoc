=== General requirements

*SPI* means Service Provider Interface that is an API intended to be implemented or extended by a third party.
SPI-API is used for connection between XS2A interface and ASPSP system, that's why this system is also called *connector*
and this word will be used in all chapters below.
XS2A provides interfaces in java (*de.adorsys.psd2.xs2a.spi.service* package), that should be implemented in the connector's code.

Basic responsibilities of the connector:

* receive the input data from XS2A;
* provide this data to the ASPSP system (and/or add some business logic, if necessary);
* retrieve the response from ASPSP system;
* provide the ASPSP system's response back to XS2A using *SpiResponse* class.

==== SPI methods common parameters

Input data for the connector is provided from TPP through XS2A and some parameters in the interfaces' signatures
are common for all of them:

* *spiContextData* - the information about PSU and TPP;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider* - this service is used for providing ASPSP consent data to connector and ASPSP system.

Other method-specific parameters are described in the chapters below.

Speaking about *SpiContextData* - first, it contains the *psuData* object. It stores data about PSU known in scope of the request:

|===
| Attribute | Type | Condition | Description

| psuId | String | Conditional | Client ID of the PSU in the ASPSP client interface
| psuIdType | String | Conditional | Type of the psuId, needed in scenarios where PSUs have several psuIds as access possibility
| psuCorporateId | String | Conditional | Identification of a corporate in the online Channels. Might be mandated in the ASPSP’s documentation. Only used in a corporate context
| psuCorporateIdType| String | Conditional | This is describing the type of the identification needed by the ASPSP to identify the psuCorporateId
|===

Another parameter in *SpiContextData* is the *tppInfo*. It contains information about the TPP's certificate:

** "Registration number": example = "1234_registrationNumber";
** "TPP name": example = "Tpp company";
** "National competent authority": example = "Bafin";

Also, SpiContextData object stores the OAuth2 token in the *oAuth2Token* field - this is the authorisation token that should be present
in any XS2A request during OAuth SCA approach. This header is passed to SPI level in each method.

The response from the connector to XS2A and the ASPSP consent data provider are described in the next chapters.

=== SpiResponse

This class acts as the container for all responses from the connector to XS2A. It is a generic class and it uses builder
pattern to create the response. Main fields of the class:

* *T payload*;
* *List<TppMessage> errors*.

*payload* should be used to create successful response to XS2A. It should contain the object which current SPI method deals with.
*errors* should be used in case the response fails. The list should contain at least one error element inside the *TppMessage*
container. It is possible to provide several errors, if necessary. *build()* method should be used to create SpiResponse
after setting payload or errors. Typical usage of builder pattern for happy-path response:

*return SpiResponse.<SpiAuthorisationStatus>builder()
                   .payload(SpiAuthorisationStatus.SUCCESS)
                   .build();*

In this example the *SpiAuthorisationStatus* enumerator value is returned.

=== Working with ASPSP-Consent-Data object

ASPSP consent data is a container that allows to handle any information about the consent or payment in scope of SPI level calls.
More detailed clarification about this object can be found
xref:../architecture/09_design_decisions.adoc[here].
XS2A provides a special interface for working with the ASPSP consent data - *de.adorsys.psd2.xs2a.spi.domain.SpiAspspConsentDataProvider*.
This interface has 3 methods:

* *loadAspspConsentData* to retrieve the ASPSP consent data;
* *updateAspspConsentData* to update this data;
* *clearAspspConsentData* to erase the ASPSP consent data.

This interface has the implementation: *SpiAspspConsentDataProviderImpl*. It should be used while working with
the existing entity of AIS consent or payment (by providing its ID) in the connector.
One should understand that it is SPI developer responsibility to update (or not) the ASPSP consent data on the connector side.
XS2A just provides a possibility to make these changes by passing the *SpiAspspConsentDataProvider* object to every SPI method.
Please note, that XS2A just stores this data in CMS as a byte array field and does not use it. Definite ASPSP consent data is
tied to the definite AIS consent or payment and stored in aspsp_consent_data CMS table.

From the connector side typical code for working with the ASPSP consent data during any SPI implementation method is the following:

* *byte[] initialAspspConsentData = aspspConsentDataProvider.loadAspspConsentData();* - to retrieve the data;
* *aspspConsentDataProvider.updateAspspConsentData("Some text data to be stored".getBytes());* - to update the data with the new one.

=== Implementation of AccountSpi

The Interface is used for AIS consent accounts SPI implementation. The following methods should be implemented:

* *requestAccountList*;
* *requestAccountDetailForAccount*;
* *requestTransactionsForAccount*;
* *requestTransactionForAccountByTransactionId*;
* *requestBalancesForAccount*;
* *requestTransactionsByDownloadLink*.

The method *requestAccountList* provides a possibility to retrieve the list of account details by given AIS consent ID and boolean flag *withBalance*.
Parameters of the method are:

* *spiContextData*;
* *withBalance* - this flag specifies if the balances would be present in the response or not;
* *spiAccountConsent*;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.

Response is a list containing the *SpiAccountDetails* entities.

The method *requestAccountDetailForAccount* provides a possibility to retrieve the data for the definite account by given consent ID,
account ID (obtained from the previous method) and boolean flag *withBalance*. Flag's operation is the same as above. Parameters are:

* *spiContextData*;
* *withBalance* - this flag specifies if the balances would be present in the response or not;
* *spiAccountReference* - holder for account ID;
* *spiAccountConsent*;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.

Response is the *SpiAccountDetails* object.

The method *requestTransactionsForAccount* provides a possibility to retrieve the list of bank transactions filtered by the period,
AIS consent account ID, status and other parameters. Parameters are:

* *spiContextData*;
* *spiTransactionReportParameters* - additional parameters for retrieving transaction list (e.g. acceptMediaType, withBalance, dateFrom, dateFrom, bookingStatus, entryReferenceFrom, deltaList);
* *spiAccountReference* - holder for account ID;
* *spiAccountConsent*;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.

The response is *SpiTransactionReport* object. It also provides the transaction list download ID, which can be used to
download a file with the list of bank transactions.

The method *requestTransactionForAccountByTransactionId* provides a possibility to retrieve the data about the bank transaction
by the given transaction ID (can be obtained from the previous method). Parameters:

* *spiContextData*;
* *transactionId* - ID of bank transaction;
* *spiAccountReference* - holder for account ID;
* *spiAccountConsent*;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.

Response is *SpiTransaction* object.

The method *requestBalancesForAccount* provides a possibility to retrieve the list of balances for the given account by its ID.
Parameters are:

* *spiContextData*;
* *spiAccountReference* - holder for account ID;
* *spiAccountConsent*;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.

Response is a list with *SpiAccountBalance* objects.

The method *requestTransactionsByDownloadLink* allows to download a list of bank transactions directly to the file. Its
parameters are:

* *spiContextData*;
* *spiAccountConsent*;
* *downloadId* - identifier for downloading the file (can be retrieved from the *requestTransactionsForAccount* SPI method call);
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.

It returns *SpiTransactionsDownloadResponse* object with the InputStream which contains the transaction list, filename (can be null)
and the size of the payload in bytes (can be null also).
From the TPP side the download can be initiated by accessing new endpoint in account controller - *GET /v1/accounts/{account-id}/transactions/download/{download-id}*.
TPP should provide the AIS consent account ID and the download ID. As a response for accessing this endpoint, the TPP
receives the stream with transaction list.

=== Implementation of AisConsentSpi

The Interface is used for AIS consent SPI implementation. The following methods should be implemented:

* *initiateAisConsent*;
* *getConsentStatus*;
* *revokeAisConsent*;
* *verifyScaAuthorisation*.

The method *initiateAisConsent* provides a possibility to create a new AIS consent from the provided data. Parameters of the method are:

* *spiContextData*;
* *spiAccountConsent* - provided data about the AIS consent from CMS;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.

Response is a *SpiInitiateAisConsentResponse* object.

The method *getConsentStatus* provides a possibility to retrieve the consent status. Parameters of the method are:

* *spiContextData*;
* *spiAccountConsent* - provided data about the AIS consent from CMS;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.

Response is a *SpiAisConsentStatusResponse* object with status and PSU message (optional).

The method *revokeAisConsent* provides a possibility to revoke the given AIS consent (change its status to `REJECTED` or
`TERMINATED_BY_TPP`). Parameters of the method are:

* *spiContextData*;
* *spiAccountConsent* - provided data about the AIS consent from CMS;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.

Response is empty (`VoidResponse` object).

The method *verifyScaAuthorisation* provides a possibility to send information about the authorisation confirmation (e.g. transaction
authorisation number or some other security code) to ASPSP. This method is used only with embedded SCA Approach. Parameters of the method are:

* *spiContextData*;
* *SpiScaConfirmation* - the information about the definite consent (its ID), corresponding PSU data and security code.
* *spiAccountConsent* - provided data about the AIS consent from CMS;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.

Response is a *SpiVerifyScaAuthorisationResponse* object that stores the status of operation.

Among the methods that were described above, this interface extends *AuthorisationSpi*, its methods are described below in the
*PaymentAuthorisationSpi* chapter.

=== Providing account resources to consent

Speaking about the AIS consent SPI implementation, please note that TPP can create the consent with provided account reference
data (such consent is called `dedicated consent`) or without one (`global` or `bank offered` consent). If the consent was
created without account reference data there is a possibility to fill it through the CMS-PSU-API after. The CMS endpoint
`/psu-api/v1/ais/consent/{internal_consent_id}/save-access` provides such functionality. Path parameter `internal_consent_id` should
be the internal CMS consent identifier. The body of this request should contain the JSON representation of account reference,
for example:

[source,json]
----
{
    "accountAccess": {
        "accounts": [
            {
                "iban": "DE80760700240271232400",
                "currency": "EUR"
            }
        ],
        "balances": [
            {
                "iban": "DE80760700240271232400",
                "currency": "EUR"
            }
        ],
        "transactions": [
            {
                "iban": "DE80760700240271232400",
                "currency": "EUR"
            }
        ]
    },
    "frequencyPerDay": 100,
    "validUntil": "2019-12-31"
}
----

After this operation the given consent's account reference data will be updated in CMS and the consent may be confirmed as usual.


=== Implementation of FundsConfirmationSpi

This interface is used for retrieving information from ASPSP in scope of Confirmation of Funds requests.

*FundsConfirmationSpi* contains only one method that should be implemented - *performFundsSufficientCheck*, which is responsible for checking whether requested account has sufficient funds.
The method returns *SpiFundsConfirmationResponse* as part of *SpiResponse* with information whether the requested amount can be booked on the account.

*performFundsSufficientCheck* takes the following arguments:

* *spiContextData* - information about the context of the call
* *spiPiisConsent* - optional PIIS consent object, will be absent if the request is done from a workflow without the consent
* *spiFundsConfirmationRequest* - information about the account and transaction amount, provided by the TPP
* *aspspConsentDataProvider* - optional ASPSP consent data provider, will be absent if the request is done from a workflow without the consent

PIIS consent will be passed to the SPI method along with ASPSP consent data provider if the ASPSP supports PIIS consents.
Otherwise both PIIS consent object and ASPSP consent data provider will be absent in the request to SPI.

=== Implementation of PaymentSpi(s)

==== CommonPaymentSpi

The Interface is used for common payments SPI implementation.

This interface will be called instead of other payment SPI interfaces if the affected payment is considered to be a common one.
Depending on <<SPI_Developer_Guide.adoc#configuring-mapping-type-specific-payments-spi,mapping configuration of payments for SPI>> this can mean either all payments, or only payments with any payment product that doesn't belong to the pre-defined list of standard JSON payment products (regardless of payment service or content type).

==== PaymentAuthorisationSpi

The Interface is used while implementing payment authorisation flow on SPI level. This Interface is implemented by extending the *AuthorisationSpi*. The following Methods should be implemented:

* *authorisePsu*;
* *requestAvailableScaMethods*;
* *requestAuthorisationCode*.

The Method *authorisePsu* authorises psu and returns current (success or failure) authorisation status with `scaExempted` flag.
This flag is taken into account by XS2A for performing SCA exemption.
If the psu authorisation spi response for bulk or single payment will be successful and `scaExempted` is `true`
- SCA will not be performed will be invoked and authorisation status will be set to `EXEMPTED`. SCA exemption is supported for multilevel SCA too.

The Method *authorisePsu should be used only with Embedded SCA Approach*. It contains following Data:

* *spiContextData*;
* *psuLoginData*: ASPSP identifier(s) of the PSU, provided by TPP within this request;
* *password*: PSU's password;
* *businessObject*: payment object;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.

The Method *requestAvailableScaMethods* returns a list of SCA methods for the PSU by its login. *Should be used only with the Embedded SCA Approach*. It contains following Data:

* *spiContextData*;
* *businessObject*;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.

The Method *requestAuthorisationCode* performs SCA depending on selected SCA method. *Should be used only with Embedded Approach*. Method returns a positive or negative response as a part of SpiResponse.
If the authentication method is unknown, then empty *SpiAuthorizationCodeResult* should be returned. It contains following data:

* *spiContextData*;
* *businessObject*;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.
* *authenticationMethodId*: ID of a chosen SCA method.

In case of *Decoupled SCA Approach*, the method *startScaDecoupled* has to be implemented: method notifies a decoupled application
about starting SCA. AuthorisationId is provided to allow the app to access CMS. It returns a response object, contains a
message from ASPSP to PSU, gives him instructions regarding decoupled SCA starting. It contains the following data:

* *spiContextData*;
* *businessObject*;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.
* *authenticationMethodId*: for a decoupled SCA method within embedded approach;
* *authorisationId*: a unique identifier of authorisation process.

==== PaymentCancellationSpi

The Interface is used to cancel a payment. The following Methods should be implemented:

* *initiatePaymentCancellation*;
* *cancelPaymentWithoutSca*;
* *verifyScaAuthorisationAndCancelPayment*.

The Method *initiatePaymentCancellation* returns the payment cancellation response with information about transaction status and whether authorisation of the request is required. It contains the following data:

* *spiContextData*;
* *payment*: payment to be cancelled;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.

The Method *cancelPaymentWithoutSca* is used by cancelling payment without performing SCA. Method returns a positive or negative payment cancellation response as part of spiResponse. It contains the following data:

* *spiContextData*;
* *payment*: payment to be cancelled;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.

The Method *verifyScaAuthorisationAndCancelPayment* sends authorisation confirmation information (secure code or such) to ASPSP and, in case of successful validation, cancels payment at ASPSP.
It returns a positive or negative response as part of spiResponse. It contains the following data:

* *spiContextData*;
* *payment* payment to be cancelled;
* *spiAspspConsentDataProvider*.
* *spiScaConfirmation*: payment cancellation confirmation information.

=== Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)

The Payment initiation depends heavily on the *Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)* approach implemented by the ASPSP. For now there are three Approaches implemented (REDIRECT, DECOUPLED and EMBEDDED).

==== SCA Approach REDIRECT

Prerequisites in case of *consent for payment initiation*:

* PSU initiated a payment by using TPP;
* PSU is authenticated via two factors: for example PSU ID and password;
* Each Payment initiation needs its consent.

When the Payment was initiated, it should be authorised by the PSU. In case of redirect approach the authorisation can be explicit or implicit.

*The explicit Start of the authorisation* process means that Payment initiation Request is followed by an explicit Request of the TPP to start the authorisation. It is followed by a redirection to the ASPSP SCA authorisation site.
A status request might be requested by the TPP after the session is redirected to the TPP's system. Redirect SCA Approach is used in case of *tppExplicitAuthorisationPreferred = true* and *signingBasketSupported = true* or in case of multilevel SCA.

* *tppExplicitAuthorisationPreferred*: value of TPP's choice of authorisation method;
* *signingBasketSupported*: indicates if signing basket is supported on the ASPSP profile. It returns _true_ if ASPSP supports signing basket, _false_ if doesn't.

In case of *implicit Start of the Authorisation process* the ASPSP needs no additional data from TPP. In this case, the redirection of the PSU browser session happens directly after the Payment Initiation Response.
Besides an SCA status request may be sent by the TPP to follow the SCA process. In this case, the authorisation is used based on *tppExplicitAuthorisationPreferred* and *signingBasketSupported values*:

* Implicit authorisation is used in all cases where *tppExplicitAuthorisationPreferred* or *signingBasketSupported not equals true*;
* Implicit approach *is impossible* in case of multilevel SCA.

For The Redirect Approach the developer needs to implement the following Methods:

* *createCommonPaymentAuthorisation*;
* *updateCommonPaymentPsuData*;
* *getAuthorisationSubResources*;
* *getAuthorisationScaStatus*;
* *getScaApproachServiceTypeProvider*.

The Method *createCommonPaymentAuthorisation* creates payment authorisation response and contains:

** *paymentId*: ASPSP identifier of a payment;
** *paymentType*: e.g. single payment, periodic payment, bulk payment;
** *psuData*: psuIdData container of authorisation data about PSU.

The Method *updateCommonPaymentPsuData* provides transporting data when updating consent psu data.
For the Redirect Approach this method is applicable for the selection of authentication methods, before choosing the actual SCA approach. It contains *request* with following data:

.Parameters
|===
| Attribute              |Type                 | Description

|paymentId               | String              | Resource identification of the related payment initiation
|authorisationId         | String              | Resource identification if the related payment initiation, Signing Basket or Consent authorisation sub-resource
|scaAuthenticationData   | String              |SCA authentication data, depending on the chosen authentication method
|psuData                 | String              | e.g. PsuId, PsuIdType, PsuCorporateId and PsuCorporateIdType
|password                | PSU Data            | Password of the psu
|authenticationMethodId  | String              | The authentication method ID as provided by the ASPSP
|scaStatus               | Sca Status          | e.g. psuIdentified
|paymentService          | String              | e.g. "payments", "bulk-payments" and "periodic-payments"
|paymentProduct          | String              | The related payment product of the payment initiation to be authorized
|updatePsuidentification | href Type           | The link to the payment initiation, which needs to be updated by the PSU identification if not delivered yet
|===

The Method *getAuthorisationSubResources* with the *paymentId* returns authorisation sub resources (e.g. list of authorisation IDs).

The Method *getAuthorisationScaStatus* with *paymentId* (ASPSP identifier of the payment, associated with the authorisation) and *authorisationId* (authorisation identifier), returns SCA status.

_Example of Sca Status:_

* RECEIVED(“received”, false): if an authorisation or cancellation-authorisation resource has been created successfully.
* PSUIDENTIFIED(“psuIdentified”, false): if the PSU related to the authorisation or cancellation-authorisation resource has been identified.

The Method *getScaApproachServiceTypeProvider* provides SCA approach used in current service. It returns the ScaApproach *“Redirect”*.

===== Redirect Approach for Payment cancellation

The Method *createCommonPaymentCancellationAuthorisation* with *paymentId*, *paymentType* and *psudata* creates payment cancellation authorisation.

The Method  *getCancellationAuthorisationSubResources* with the *paymentId* returns authorisation sub resources.

The Method *updateCommonPaymentCancellationPsuData* updates the cancellation for the payment.

The Method *getCancellationAuthorisationScaStatus* with *PaymentId* and *CancellationId* (Resource identification of the related Payment Cancellation authorisation sub-resource) returns SCA status.

The Method *getScaApproachServiceTypeProvider* provides SCA approach used in current service. It returns the ScaApproach *“Redirect”*.

==== SCA Approach EMBEDDED

Embedded SCA approach indicates that the whole authorisation process is going to be performed through the XS2A interface, without any redirect to the online banking.
For this purposes, XS2A interface provides the following endpoints:

* `PUT /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}` for payment initiation flow;
* `PUT /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/cancellation-authorisations/{cancellationId}` for payment cancellation flow;
* `PUT /v1/consents/{consentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}` for consent initiation flow.

Embedded SCA Approach uses the same list of methods as Redirect SCA Approach:

* *createCommonPaymentAuthorisation*;
* *updateCommonPaymentPsuData*;
* *getAuthorisationSubResources*;
* *getAuthorisationScaStatus*;
* *getScaApproachServiceTypeProvider*.

After the successful authorisation start (either explicit or implicit), TPP should update the authorisation with data, provided by PSU.
Depending on the amount of SCA methods PSU has, the amount of PSU data, has to be provided, differs.
In case when PSU has zero SCA methods, only password should be provided.
In case when PSU has one SCA method, the password should be provided as well as authentication data (e.g. TAN received by email or SMS).
In case when PSU has more than one SCA method, PSU should first provide password, then select the preferred SCA method and then - the authentication data.
For each PSU data update, the same update endpoint should be called, but with corresponding body.

For example, PSU with two SCA methods initiates a payment.
Assume that the payment was created and the authorisation has started.
Now TPP should update PSU data three times:

* first `PUT /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}` call with PSU password in HTTP body

----
{
 	"psuData": {
 		"password": "mypassword"
 	}
}
----

* second `PUT /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}` call with selected SCA method in HTTP body

----
{
    "authenticationMethodId": "selectedSCAMethod"
}
----

* third `PUT /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}` call with authentication data in HTTP body

----
{
	"scaAuthenticationData": "TANNumber"
}
----

After this steps, the payment initiation authorisation process will be finished.

==== SCA Approach DECOUPLED

Decoupled SCA approach implies that authorsation will be performed with a help of dedicated mobile app, or any other application or device which is independent from the online banking frontend.
The workflow of Decoupled SCA approach is a short version of Embedded SCA approach.
After TPP updates PSU password via

* `PUT /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}`,
* `PUT /v1/{payment-service}/{payment-product}/{paymentId}/cancellation-authorisations/{cancellationId}` or
* `PUT /v1/consents/{consentId}/authorisations/{authorisationId}`

endpoints, the response from ASPSP asks PSU to proceed authorisation in dedicated device.
No further authorisation calls from TPP are needed.
PSU uses the dedicated device and finishes authorisation process there.

Decoupled SCA Approach uses the same list of methods as Redirect SCA Approach:

* *createCommonPaymentAuthorisation*;
* *updateCommonPaymentPsuData*;
* *getAuthorisationSubResources*;
* *getAuthorisationScaStatus*;
* *getScaApproachServiceTypeProvider*.

=== Multicurrency Accounts

Multicurrency accounts support can be enabled in ASPSP Profile by setting `multicurrencyAccountLevelSupported` property to `AGGREGATION_AND_SUBACCOUNT` or `AGGREGATION` value.
By default, `multicurrencyAccountLevelSupported` property is set to `SUBACCOUNT`.
When TPP asks for account list information or account information (*requestAccountList* or *requestAccountDetailForAccount* method in AccountSpi), ASPSP can return *null* in currency field.
In such case, XS2A will mark `currency` field with `XXX` text.

=== Get SPI SCA status

ASPSP should have a possibility to update authorisation status from bank's internal system related to consent/payment confirmation due to the fact that not every system is capable of updating the status in CMS.
For this reason AuthorisationSpi has method `getScaStatus` which calls ASPSP for actual status. The CMS SCA status will be updated if it is not final and differs from the bank.
By default, SCA status is used from CMS on request for getting SCA status.
