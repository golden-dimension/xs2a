=== Multi-tenancy support

By default, multi-tenancy mode is disabled.
Multi-tenancy is an architecture in which a single instance of a software application serves multiple customers.
Each customer shares the software applications (ASPSP Profile, CMS) and shares a single database. Each tenant’s data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.

ASPSP Profile supports multi-tenancy mode. Configuration can be done by switching flag on and registering all supporting bank profiles in `application.yml`:

```
xs2a.bank_profile.multitenancy.enabled=true
xs2a.bank_profile.multitenancy.customBankProfiles={bank1:'classpath:bank1_profile.yml', bank2:'classpath:bank2_profile.yml'}
```

When multi-tenancy is enabled and fully configured additional header `instance-id` is required for all HTTP requests, otherwise get an error 400 `BAD_REQUEST`.

It's possible to use CMS database in multi-tenancy mode, with multiple XS2A instances being connected to one CMS database.
This approach is not recommended and in general multiple XS2A instances should be used with their own database instances.
But if it's still necessary to use one database, CMS should be additionally configured to support this mode.

Each record in the database that should be isolated from different XS2A instances contains `instance_id` column, which indicates particular XS2A instance that created this resource.
To access such resource, appropriate `instanceId` value should be passed to methods and endpoints in `cms-psu-api` and `cms-aspsp-api`.
Default value for `instanceId` is set to `UNDEFINED`.

To configure CMS service to properly work with multiple XS2A instances, multiple instances of `cms-standalone-service` can be used, with `xs2a.cms.service.instance-id` property set to appropriate value for each instance.
Alternatively, some kind of an interceptor should be implemented in CMS (or in connector application in case of using CMS in embedded mode) to set `instanceId` property before saving records to the database.
Example of Hibernate interceptor with such functionality can be found in `cms-standalone-service`: in `de.adorsys.psd2.consent.config.ServiceInstanceIdEventListener`, along with the configuration in `de.adorsys.psd2.consent.config.HibernateListenerConfig`.

=== Support multi-tenancy in XS2A

XS2A supports multi-tenancy with 1 database and 1 CMS instances.
Request header `Instance-ID` defines a current tenant. The header is not mandatory.

Response link `scaRedirect` will include `Instance-ID` parameter if the mentioned header comes with request.

SPI objects `SpiAccountConsent`, `SpiPaymentInfo`, `SpiSinglePayment` and `SpiBulkPayment` were extended for `instanceId` field.

=== Support multi-tenancy in ASPSP Profile

ASPSP Profile supports more than one ASPSP profiles. In this mode ASPSP Profile needs to be configured for each supporting instances separately.
HTTP header `instance-id` is required for all requests to the profile otherwise error will occur.

To enable multi tenancy in ASPSP Profile in `application.yml` set flag and register config profiles for every tenant:

```
xs2a.bank_profile.multitenancy.enabled=true
xs2a.bank_profile.multitenancy.customBankProfiles={bank1:'classpath:bank1_profile.yml', bank2:'classpath:bank2_profile.yml'}
```

By default, multi-tenancy mode for ASPSP Profile is disabled.

=== Configure Event-Service in embedded mode

XS2A is started as a standalone application in embedded mode (*Xs2aStandaloneStarter*).
CMS does not start at all.

*Xs2aStandaloneStarter* application has database configuration, event service and CMS parts inside.

* Update *application.properties* of *xs2a-standalone-starter* by adding database configuration:

----
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/consent
spring.datasource.username=cms
spring.datasource.password=cms
----

* Remove maven dependencies in *xs2a-standalone-starter* pom.xml:

----
 <dependency>
     <groupId>de.adorsys.psd2</groupId>
     <artifactId>consent-xs2a-client</artifactId>
     <version>${project.version}</version>
 </dependency>

<dependency>
     <groupId>de.adorsys.psd2</groupId>
     <artifactId>event-service-rest-client</artifactId>
     <version>${project.version}</version>
 </dependency>
----

* Add maven dependencies in *xs2a-standalone-starter* pom.xml:

----

----

* Update scan annotations in *Xs2aStandaloneStarter.java*:

----
   @ComponentScan(basePackages = "de.adorsys.psd2")
   @EnableTransactionManagement
   @EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = {"de.adorsys.psd2.consent.repository", "de.adorsys.psd2.event"})
   @EntityScan({"de.adorsys.psd2.consent.domain", "de.adorsys.psd2.event.persist.entity"})

==== Getting events

There are 5 endpoints for getting events:

`GET aspsp-api/v1/events`

`GET aspsp-api/v1/events/consent/{consent-id}`

`GET aspsp-api/v1/events/payment/{payment-id}`

`GET aspsp-api/v1/events/type/{event-type}`

`GET aspsp-api/v1/events/origin/{event-origin}`

Request parameters for the all 5 endpoints above are passed as headers:

.Request Headers
|===
|Header |Required |Default value

|start-date |true |
|end-date |true |
|instance-id |false |UNDEFINED
|===

Description:

* `GET aspsp-api/v1/events`  --  Use endpoint for getting events *by period*
and *instance_id*.

* `GET aspsp-api/v1/events/consent/{consent-id}`  --  Use endpoint for getting events *by period*
and *instance_id* with specific consent
identifier *consent_id*.

.Path variable usage.

==== Configuring events recording

Recording of events can be tweaked by using custom implementations of interfaces from *event-service-persist-api*.
Two implementations of these interfaces are provided by default in separate modules:
- implementation for saving events to the database, can be enabled by adding dependency to the *event-service-persist-db-impl*
- implementation for logging events, can be enabled by adding dependency to the *event-service-persist-log-impl*

These modules don't provide implementation of *de.adorsys.psd2.event.persist.EventReportRepository* for generating event reports.
This means that either default implementation for reading events from the database should be added as a dependency (*event-service-db-report-impl*), endpoints for retrieving events report from the *cms-aspsp-api* should be disabled, or custom implementation of the interface should be provided.

Logging implementation uses *SLF4J* for recording events, meaning that it's possible to configure and use any logging framework that's compatible with *SLF4J*.
All events are being written to a separate logger *event-log* at *INFO* level.
See <<SPI_Developer_Guide.adoc#configuring-logging,XS2A Logging configuring>> for more details on how to configure *SLF4J* logging.

==== Adjusting swagger UI

Swagger UI is not enabled for XS2A by default.

To enable Swagger in XS2A you have to add `@EnableXs2aSwagger` annotation on any of Spring configuration classes / Spring boot Application class in your application.

To disable Swagger just remove it.

Adjustment Swagger UI implies updating appropriate .yaml file:

* At first put PSD2 API yaml file to the resource folder of your Connector to override default PSD2 API and set `xs2a.swagger.psd2.api.location` property in your application.properties file e.g. `xs2a.swagger.psd.api.location=path/in/my/classpath/my_swagger_api.yml`
* Next steps involve adding and changing necessary parameters in the .yaml file.

The default version of PSD2 API yaml file can be found under:

----
xs2a-impl->src->main->resources->static->psd2-api....yaml
----

NOTE: for adding additional products e.g., it should be updated ASPSP-Profile as well.
