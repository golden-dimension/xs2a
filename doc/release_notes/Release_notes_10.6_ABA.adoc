* Changed transactionDetails structure
* Removed withBalance field from read card transactions list

== Changed transactionDetails structure

From now on, `transactionDetails` are stored in `Transactions` object, and response has correct structure. Before they were stored in `transactionDetailsBody` object, and this was the cause of the incorrect structure of the response. Unnecessary `TransactionDetailsBody` object model was removed.

== Removed withBalance field from read card transactions list

From now on withBalance field is removed from read card transactions list, since it is not required under implementation guidelines version 1.3.8.
