* Changed transactionDetails structure

== Changed transactionDetails structure

From now on, `transactionDetails` are stored in `Transactions` object, and response has correct structure. Before they were stored in `transactionDetailsBody` object, and this was the cause of the incorrect structure of the response. Unnecessary `TransactionDetailsBody` object model was removed.
